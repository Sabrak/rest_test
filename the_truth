From ancient times sages were seeking
For the forgotten truth’s footprints.
And they for long were loud-speaking
The usual speeches of old flints.
They were repeating: “The truth-treasure 
Had hidden self into a well.”
And, drinking water all together,
Were crying: “There we’ll find it, well!”
But someone faithful friend of mortals,
(Maybe Silen this person was)
The witness of their disputes, thoughtless,
Had tired of water and of noise,
Left all attempts to find the holly,
And thought about wine, the first, 
And, having drunk a bowl, whole,
Saw, on its bottom, the truth, lost.
